# Snowy Escape :snowflake:

Escape to your own personal log cabin in the woods. Enjoy the ambient sounds of a roaring fireplace during a snowstorm.

## Setup

[Install Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/getting-started) if you don't already have it. All you really need is [node/npm](https://nodejs.org/) and the [Grunt CLI](http://gruntjs.com/getting-started#installing-the-cli).

In the root of the the project folder run:
```
npm install
```
This will download the needed dependencies set for this project. In order to compile as well as watch for changes from sass partials and js files run:
```
grunt
```
